## Self Evaluation
- I'm feeling fairly confident with arrays!
- I think most of the learning that I need in regard to arrays will come with using them - a lot of googling and memorization
- I have a couple questions about specific methods - What's the difference between .delete() and .delete_at()? What about .append vs. .push?
